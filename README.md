# Facial-Recognition
Upon running the code, it will open a window displaying whatever is in front of your screen using your computer's camera. If there is a face within this box, whether it be a real person standing in front of the computer or an image of a face, a green box will appear around the face. It can detect multiple faces at once. To end the code, press the "q" key.
